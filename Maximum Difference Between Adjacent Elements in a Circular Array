/*Maximum Difference Between Adjacent Elements in a Circular Array
Given a circular array nums, find the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements.
Note: In a circular array, the first and last elements are adjacent.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,4]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Because nums is circular, nums[0] and nums[2] are adjacent. They have the maximum absolute difference of |4 - 1| = 3.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-5,-10,-5]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The adjacent elements nums[0] and nums[1] have the maximum absolute difference of |-5 - (-10)| = 5.
